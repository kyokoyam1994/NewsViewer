# NewsViewer

News article viewer written in Kotlin using News API

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need an API Key for News API. You can get one for free by signing up for an account on their official website: https://newsapi.org/

Additionally, you will also need to have Gradle installed on your machine.

## Installation Instructions


Once you have cloned the project, you will need to go to the .gradle folder in your home directory (This is usually found under C:\Users\\username\\.gradle for Windows).

Inside your .gradle folder, go to your gradle.properties file (if it's not there, make one) and add the following line to the file:

NewsViewer_APIKey="YOURAPIKEY"

Replace YOURAPIKEY with your actual API key that you received from the News API website (keep the quotations) and resync your project in Android Studio. The application should now compile properly.
